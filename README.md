# Fibonacci-Primes
Math Research Project

These are some of my programs that I used for my math research project on finding Fibonacci primes. 
#
I used various methods such as Fermat's little theorem to speed up the calculations. 

# Using code from my math reseaercgh ckass  i developed different algoriothms .
